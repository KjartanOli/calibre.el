Calibre.el is a package for interacting with Calibre
https://calibre-ebook.com/ libraries from Emacs. It's primary features
include:
- Easily switch between multiple libraries
- List the contents of your library
- Add and remove books from your library
- Read your books in Emacs

Calibre.el uses the built in SQLite support introduced in Emacs 29,
and therefore requires an Emacs >= 29 compiled with SQLite support.
Adding and removing books from a library requires a working calibredb
executable, i.e. a Calibre installation.  Even if Calibre is not
installed you will still be able to view the contents of existing
libraries.
